# 1. Core product Statement

In the official strava app you cannot have your whole year review at one glance. the global year map is a key feature. this app is dedicated for casual runner, data nerd and traveler. Competitie athlete and coach are not concerned. When opening the app I'd like the runner to see his global year map (all the path that he has taken). I'd like to motivate them to explore new area around them that look beautiful. Also there is a statistic page full of beautiful chart that they can share on social networks.
